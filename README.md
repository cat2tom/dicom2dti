=========

**TEMPORARY REPO*** with Matlab tools to process diffusion MRI studies (DICOM) into manageable DTI (NIFTI). 
As well as some supporting visualization and conversion tools to connect with my tractography software CrimsonLake.

This will soon be probably merged into CrimsonLake project, or JHUToolbox.
